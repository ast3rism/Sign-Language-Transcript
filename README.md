Signlanguage Transcript v 1.0

The Sign Language Transcription system utilizes an effective model that
converts sign language gestures into text. This system employs computer
vision and machine learning algorithms to identify hand movements and
gestures, thereby facilitating communication between differently abled
individuals and those who are unfamiliar with sign language.

This project introduces a state-of-the-art sign language transcription
system capable of translating static and dynamic gestures into text in
real-time, achieving an accuracy rate of up to 99.2% by utilizing Random
Forests and deep learning technologies.
