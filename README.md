Signlanguage Transcript v 1.0

The Sign Language Transcript is developed using an efficient model for translating sign
language gestures into text. This system leverages computer vision & machine learning
algorithms to recognize hand movements and gestures, bridging the communication gap
between differently abled individuals and ones who do not understand sing language.

This project presents a cutting-edge sign language transcription system designed to 
convert static and dynamic gestures into text using Random Forests and deep learning
technologies in realtime with an accuracy score of upto 99.2%.
